            <summary>Why is the moon sometimes out during the day</summary>
            <p>The Moon can sometimes appear in the sky during the daytime because it is the closest object to Earth, and because its orbital cycle means that sometimes it is brighter in the day than at night. </p>

            <summary>Why is the sky blue</summary>
            <p>Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. </p>
